Magus Adventure is a side-srolling action game built in Game Maker studio 2 with an online leaderboard that uses a node/express API to post and retrieve scores. It uses art assets from classic games, opengameart.org, and this course on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/make-an-action-rpg-in-gamemaker-studio-2/learn/v4/overview. 

To run this game, either clone this repo and run Magus Adventure.zip to install the game, or get the .zip file from https://ufile.io/4s1yu.  

How to play: use the arrow keys for movement, Enter to open the inventory, Z, X and C to use the items you have equipped. To equip an item, in the inventory move the cursor to that item and press whichever of the three action keys you want to assign the item to.
